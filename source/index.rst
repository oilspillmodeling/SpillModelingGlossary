Introduction
============

The oil spill modeling community has, over the years, developed particular uss for terms that are particular to oil spill modleing. Many of these terms have slightly different definitions in other fields, so it can be hwlpful to clearly define how they are used in oil spill modeling.

Glossary
========


Dispersant
----------

A mixture of emulsifiers and solvents that helps break oil into small droplets following an oil spill.

`Dispersant Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_dispersants>`_



Dispersion
----------

In the oil spill modeling (and oil spill response) community, dispersion refers to the process of oil being broken up into very small droplets that tend to stay mixed into the water column, rather than rising back to the surface to


This can be a bit confusing, as in the general sense,
"dispersion" is defined as:

   The action or process of distributing things or people over a wide area

And it is often used in the oceanographic community to describe a variety of processes that "distribute" tracers or contaminants -- vertical mixing and diffusion, horizontal transport, etc.

Often dispersion is referred to as "Natural Dispersion" or "Chemical Dispersion" depending on whether chemical dispersants were applied to the oil. But the physical process is the same. Some prefer the term "Chemically Enhanced Dispersion" for dispersion that occurs when dispersants have been applied.


Emulsion
--------

An emulsion is:

  A fine dispersion of minute droplets of one liquid in another in which it is not soluble or miscible

In the spill modeling community the term is usually used specifically for the water-in-oil emulsions that often form when oil is exposed to mixing energy on the surface of the water.




Entrainment
-----------

Entrainment is used to describe the process of oil being broken into droplets, and mixed into the water. Ususally used in the context of mixing into the near surface


Mousse
------

A colloquial term for an :ref:`emulsion`


Spreading
