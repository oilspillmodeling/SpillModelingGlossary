A Glossary of terms used for Oil Spill Modeling

The oil spill modeling community has, over the years, developed particular uses for terms that are particular to oil spill modeling. Many of these terms have slightly different definitions in other fields, so it can be helpful to clearly define how they are used in the field of oil spill modeling.

This repository serves as a place where the greater spill modeling community can collaborate on the development of this Glossary

How these pages are built
-------------------------

These pages are built with the `Sphinx Documentation System <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ It uses a fairly simple text-based markup ( `ReStuctured Text <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ ). It may not be an ideal format, but it's easy to work with and easy to convert to other methods in the future.

This repository is set to auto-build and publish the doc every time a change is pushed to master.

If you want to contribute a little bit, don't worry about it -- simply edit the text as you think makes sense, make a Pull Request, and someone else can clean up the formatting later. If you want to make major contributions, then it would make sense to learn more about Sphinx and RST, and get Sphinx up and running on your own computer so you can test it there.
